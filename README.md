# Simple-POS-for-a-store-exercise-

This was made for a project in my C++ Class, where we had to make a simple terminal for a small store, that allows you to:

- Make a sale, with a number of client, and prints the receipt at the end
- Create products, add stocks and delete products
- Create clientes, Change clients names and delete clients
- And also does sales reports

the program still has some problems, namely in the reports part that i'm working on fixing in the near future

also we could onlny use functions and data structures, no  classes or objects for this project
